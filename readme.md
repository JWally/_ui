#Hello World!

This is my preferred user interface development environment. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
Without me, it is nothing. Without it; I usually waste 2 days trying to remember how to set everything up
or ripping out components from prior projects making a mess. *barf* 

Here are some instructinos on how to use:
1. Install Node
2. npm install
3. bower install
4. bomb.sh
