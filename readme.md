##Wait...what?
>To make my projects as easy and repeatable as possible, I'm putting a development environment in git that I can use whenever I want to start up a new project. In the past, this meant going to the last successful project, trying to dismantle it, and cobble it together to fit the next project. Yuck city. This is a living project and document, so it will probably evolve over time, and branch as things come in / go out of vogue.

##What's Assumed
>Right now, I'm using the following for the UI

1. backbone.js - User interface
2. require.js - To modularize files
3. grunt - To build and compress everything

>Here are some instructions on how to use:

1. Install Node
2. npm install
3. bower install
4. bomb.sh
