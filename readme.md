#_ui: My UI Build Environment

This is my preferred user interface development environment. 

There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Without me, it is nothing. 

Without it; I usually waste 2 days trying to remember how to set everything up or ripping out components from prior projects making a mess. *barf* 

##Wait...what?
To make my projects as easy and repeatable as possible, I'm putting a development environment in git that I can use whenever I want to start up a new project. In the past, this meant going to the last successful project, trying to dismantle it, and cobble it together to fit the next project. Yuck city. This is a living project and document, so it will probably evolve over time, and branch as things come in / go out of vogue.

##What's Assumed
Here's what I'm using for my projects-du-jour

### Front - End

1. [Backbone.js](backbonejs.org) - MV.* Front End JavaScript Library
2. [RequireJS](requirejs.org) - JavaScript file loader which allows modularity
3. [Twitter - Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com) - Its reputation precedes it...such wow!

### Back - End
1. [Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node) - javaScript
3. grunt - To build and compress everything
